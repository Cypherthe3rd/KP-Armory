Also contains minor quality of life improvements to fuel cells and wheels. Compatible with Waterfall.

KP Interstellar - A small mod adding an extremely efficient but thermally demanding vacuum engine, a large radiator, and ball fuel tank. Allows for interstellar transits or rapid in-system travel with minimal changes to stock. Compatible with Waterfall. Some parts use art modified from the works of Nearta and Porkjet in compliance with respective licenses.
