A lightweight, stockalike and physically accurate mod enabling the creation of watercraft and submarines with minimal complexity and additions to the stock game. Includes three different sizes of propellers and variable ballast tanks, which realistically simulate thrust and buoyancy across multiple environments including other celestial bodies. Also contains minor quality of life improvements to fuel cells and wheels. Compatible with Waterfall.


### KP Interstellar

A small mod adding an extremely efficient but thermally demanding vacuum engine, a large radiator, and ball fuel tank. Allows for interstellar transits or rapid in-system travel with minimal changes to stock. Compatible with Waterfall. Some parts use art modified from the works of Nearta and Porkjet in compliance with respective licenses.


### KP Armory

An addon for BDArmory, adding two new radars and a high-powered microwave turret.
